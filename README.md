littlejs
========

Little javascript library for providing basic DOM manipulations.

Its a simple set of functions which can help web developers to add basic DOM manipulation effect to the website without using jquery. It can be useful for simple single page applications where for simple DOM related tasks, adding whole jquery and learning to use it is a bit tedious for people with little knowledge of JS.

To use it, simply include the file and remove the properties from little object which won't be useful.

PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE ELEMENTBASE AND GETELEMENT PROPERTIES.
